# Tech Stack

- [MVVM Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - A software architecture that removes the tight coupling between components. Most importantly, in this architecture, the children don't have the direct reference to the parent, they only have the reference by observables.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Jetpack Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
    - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)- Modern toolkit for building native UI.
    - [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
- [Compose Destinations](https://composedestinations.rafaelcosta.xyz/) - A KSP library that processes annotations and generates code that uses Official Jetpack Compose Navigation under the hood.
- [Landscapist - CoilImage Loader](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist) - Landscapist is a Jetpack Compose image loading library which fetches and displays network images with **Glide**, **Coil**, and **Fresco**.

- [Compose Pagination](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/paging) - The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe http client 
and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [Lottie Files for Compose](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie) - Lottie is a library for Android, iOS, and Web that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and renders them natively on mobile and on the web!
- [GSON](https://github.com/square/gson) - JSON Parser,used to parse 
requests on the data layer for Entities and understands Kotlin non-nullable 
and default parameters.
- [OkHttp Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines.
- [Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
